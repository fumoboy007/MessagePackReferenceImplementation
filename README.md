# MessagePackReferenceImplementation

A Swift reference implementation of the MessagePack [specification](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md).

This is a lightweight wrapper around the canonical [C implementation](http://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/tree/c_master) that can be used to verify compliance of a [real Swift implementation](https://github.com/fumoboy007/msgpack-swift) with the specification. Do not use this library in non-test targets.
